      <p>Goals:</p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        To see what I think is feasible by building out core mechanics of the game. Although I have used Unity before, I
        do not have the extensive experience that would make me extremely confident in achieving the end product I want
        in the amount of time that I want.

      <h3>Week 2</h3>
      <p> This week I created a new character, started building the background.</p>
      <br></br>
      <h3>Week 3</h3>
      <p> So far this week I have: </p>
