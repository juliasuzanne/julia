Don’t force something to happen that doesn’t want to be, allow things to occur on their own in their own time. As the man is hanging (placidly) upside down, it may also indicate a change in perspective or point of view. All will be revealed in due time, but for now, float easily in the waters of life’s tides.",

It is only through moments of stillness that can gain enough time for our internal wisdom to speak. Where will your shining star guide you, what is it illuminating?

The Lovers can be indicative of a new relationship or deepening existing one, but always with the intention of embracing and integrating the inherent duality present in everyone, you are yours before you are anyone else’s and you are always whole. No one can “complete” you, the person you are looking for is you- as they say, you’ll find the one when you realise that you are the one. The most important relationship you will ever have in life is first and foremost the one you have with yourself, and from this will stem everything else. How can you accept all sides of yourself, including your “shadow side” and parts that want healing? We are in a constant state of flux, balancing Yin and Yang, The Lovers card reminds us of this. What you love in someone else is what you love about yourself, and likewise what you judge others for is what you judge yourself for. What do your triggers have to teach you?",

Generally, as Jupiter is a positive planet, it signals good luck, but is still a reminder to enjoy the present moment as best you can, remaining aware of the impermanent nature of things.",

Like all the other cards in the Tarot, when you pull The Sun, it does not necessarily mean that your life is, or will be, full of vitality, vibrancy, abundance, and joy (although it certainly can do!) but rather it asks where can you look to find these things and appreciate them, revelling in the gratitude. If you get The Sun card and your life is full of happiness and success then awesome! Hope for more of the same. However, if you pull it and you do not currently experience these things, it is a gentle reminder that brighter days are always coming and what can you see that you are surrounded with right now that makes you feel full? It can be as simple as a beautiful sunny day, a warm friend, a delicious cup of coffee that you can afford to treat yourself with. Abundance is all around us if we look.",

How can you embrace your inner sanctuary of peace and trust in the natural process of things while holding onto a sense of serenity and tranquility, comfortable in not having it all at once? Is there somewhere your internal fire needs to be tamed or restrained in some way?",

Take an honest look and congratulate yourself on how far you’ve come (which is often further than we give ourselves credit for). Look to where you were a month ago, a year ago- how have you grown? What do you leave behind you and how have you affected those around you? It also asks us to completely own all aspects of ourselves and the part we played in every situation we have been in, good and bad. How did we get there, what would we do differently now?",

She, too, has the infinity symbol above her head (like The Magician), symbolic of her eternal courage, our internal fountain of bravery knows no limits. As she is gently opening the lion’s mouth, we can see that it is in moments of tender vulnerability when we are in fact strongest. She is not dressed in fighting amour, nor charging ahead, but is quietly composed, steadfast in the knowledge of her capabilities. Where is your inner voice roaring when it should perhaps be more confident as a whisper?",

The Tower represents the crumbling of false foundations, collapse of unstable beliefs, and the cataclysmic destruction of anything that was created on shaky ground. Sometimes this can relate to things that previously served us that have run their course, other times it is the seismic shifts of something that should have never been erected in the first place. Whatever it is, The Tower brings change. This may also be a lesson we didn’t take heed to in the past, which could have more naturally, but not necessarily less painfully (such as with Death), shifted in its own due time that we chose to ignore. What may have started as a whisper is now a rumbling thunder and clap of lightening that will force change upon us whether we want it or not. However, that’s not to say that The Tower has to be difficult, it may be something you were aware needed to evolve, or it could be a small thing that has run its course.",
