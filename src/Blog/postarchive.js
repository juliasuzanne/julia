I spent some time thinking about what specifically attracts me to each of these things and listed out the elements I want to include. I don't know how this directly influenced my process but it did help because I came up with an idea that is a more gamified, fun version of the sort of biographical story I had started out with in the beginning.

Backstory is you agreed to wipe your memory and live in this amusement park as a re-enactment of another planet.  In the end, you have the choice to return to your old life and reconcile with your past, to move to the alien planet, or to stay in the re-enactment.  Every day you have to do an interview, a tour with a group, and learn a new skill in the morning. You have the afternoons/evenings to yourself, but sometimes there are tourists.   “Yes, I would say it’s quite nice here. There’s plenty of food and not a lot of stress. I think the downsides are the lack of privacy. I’m hoping that in the future the emphasis will be on preservation rather than entertainment.  I do have a friend who escaped. She sends me mail very passive aggressively saying things like ‘You need to get out of there, it’s better here, blah blah blah’. But I’m quite happy where I am, yes.  The other good thing is all the different creatures and animals here. I have many different friends that I would miss.”  FIRST SCENE - At home Mail - you gotta get out of there note from friend who escaped Bird visit up Cat is sitting, meows and translates to what they’re saying Make breakfast Choice between dutch baby, eggs, toast, kolache, pumpkin pancake Find keys, wallet, phone Look at map  SECOND SCENE - Outside Get buzzed/bell rung for the interview",

I had to figure this out before creating the backgrounds so I knew I could use them. Here is the few lines of code I learned and edited from surfing stackoverflow: float ScaleValue = 0.6f - (gameObject.transform.position.y / 100);          gameObject.transform.localScale = new Vector3(ScaleValue, ScaleValue, ScaleValue); I ended up making it variable so I can change it from the inspector for different scenes. It's working great! I used localScale before, but it was inconsistent and if I went up and down too many times in the same scene the player would become distorted.",

I also learned a little more above navmesh areas, I was encountering a glitch where the player animation would not stop playing because it's condition that it reaches the target position was not met. This was due to the overlarge margin on the navmesh where there was an obstacle. After messing with the voxel size and humanoid radius it runs much better. I'm really glad I got this figured out.

I guess I wanted it to look a little more experimental. By that I mean using more different techniques and mixing genres. But maybe it is what it is and it\'s good. The new story I have conceptualized as starting as just an arm with an eyeball, and each stage of the game you gain more of yourself (literally). I still want the game to be about connection and self reflection. I feel really attracted to this sort of philosophical angle where you have this struggle to reach a transcendent state but become accepting of the reality of the human body and human world. I\'m thinking the character will encounter "soul mates", two different pieces of people who are looking for each other and have conflicting ideas about why they got removed from each other. In the end, you connect with different versions of yourself to meet the "boss", a machine version of the self that separated the parts of the body in the first place. That is what I have so far. It still needs to be fleshed out.',

At least I believe that is what happened. It was strange because it looked like a glitch I had with the camera before, when I started doing the arrow key style movement in the first scene with a new player script, but that was a case of z-indices and the 'follow' object I use to offset the camera panning with cinemachine. I also had to adjust the way gravity works, because I was messing with it in the second cave falling scene it stopped working in the first, I'm starting to learn a little bit more how to organize scripts in a way that makes sense based on how I've made troubleshooting slightly more difficult for myself.",

I used a video for the first one, and based this one off of that, but it just didn't fit in the world of the game so this one is made of clay and a bead. I added animations for falling, making a fist while hanging, and walking so far. I have incorporated them into the game with animation controller objects to act as the intermediary between the other scripts and the animator's parameters which has simplified me remembering where things are, which I need to do more of. I also had to change some of the way the color gets applied and created a separate script that can just be popped on any object which is helpful and was super easy to do.",

          "Persephone’s Game (for I know not what I do) High Level Story  A hand is hanging in a cave, just a shadow. Make friends with a pile of rocks to set skin color, see yourself, and get basic information like how to use the inventory.  Start to collect items for future use from within the cave.  Escape while hurting yourself to break down the rocks in the cave and get out, destroying the tower.  Come out into a storm, in the forest/pond. Take some drugs to feel differently in the forest. Go through a maze to find different people and items while trying to find your way to the pond. Side quest, go with a woman who convinces you you’re her arm and go into an arm farm, need to escape with the other arms At the pond, meet a witch who lives there and will teach you a few simple things. Something strange is in the pond  Find a way to see your reflection to grab your second arm. Gather muscle strength until you are truly connected. Once you have two arms, you learn the secret of reflection and can create a reflection to jump into by using optical illusions. This will change the other world.  Spite any enemies you’ve made or give gifts to anyone you’ve made friends with before you can discover the highway.  On the highway, find a dress and a magazine, start to fashion yourself into a person.  Figure out how to hitchhike to travel.  Go to different fast food chains, dollar stores, thrift stores, family owned stores, antique stores, book stores, etc.  Option to ravage either a car crash for a leg or mechanical items to create your own. Side quest to put together either.  With a leg, you are spotted and become famous for being a freak in the fast food world. People come to you to ask you to farm your flesh for eating in their fast food. You consider their proposition and start to hear from different perspectives. Choose a friend and a path.  If you go with the flesh farm, you slowly become a robot that will eventually steal the initial flesh and hide it in a cave, starting over from the beginning.  If you go with the opposition, you will be hidden in a town and you can teach them your secret of reflection to enter a better town. While studying with these people, you will grow a brain. Mini-level to build pathways.  Dating/friendship social game where you meet different people and see how they live. Learn how to cook, sew, and learn how babies are made.   Privately doing wild things at home  If you fail to make a friend, you start to murder people and create your own friends a la Frankenstein. You are found out by the authorities and they replace your brain with a robot brain. The robot disassembles the body and places it back in the cave.  If you make friends, you live until you are introduced to Persophone. She shows you the secret underground train, which takes you to many surreal worlds. Room games (psychology kokology games) happen here, where she learns about you and how to control you. You develop human flaws and start to remember who you are.  When you remember who you are, you can leave and meet yourself. You split into your corporeal form and your spiritual form. You can then decide whether to transcend or to continue to stay and live your life.",

She's basically an object of her parents, Demeter and Zeus, and a wife-object to Hades. They make all these deals about her without her knowledge or consent. She is sort of passive throughout, although she \"defies\" Hades by not eating for a long time in the underworld. I always felt like she deserved her own story, like how Wicked is Elpheba's story. I think it's a beautiful metaphor for a coming of age story that is marked by learning about death and human sin. I wanted to create this game in Persephone's name (which can be interpreted just as 'maiden') not to tell her story but to honor the idea of embracing all sides of oneself through experience and humility, and yes, death.",

I decided to make a list of simple features (inventory interaction, quests, dialogue, combat) and build the story around the game moments that come from these features. The things I have been expecting myself to create are a bit outside of my experience level and it's been too frustrating. It's like I am not getting along with my coworkers, but I am my only coworker, haha. A good lesson to be aware of being more decisive when I'm working with others to avoid annoying them as I have annoyed myself. Hopefully I will emerge victorious with a great outline for a scene using these simple features. I re-played the first half of Sally Face this week which also gave me some inspiration because it's built in unity and is very simple in the game mechanics.",

I ended up getting a Rustoleum plastic primer, acrylic paint, and Rustoleum acrylic sealant after trying many combinations, as well as enamel and other spray paints. I tested them by rubbing them and scratching them and bumping them together. I did similar tests on legos to see how it would compare. I also cured the casts a little bit to make them a bit harder, not sure if this was a good move or not. I did the minimum recommended time if you so choose to cure them.",

          "In preparing a presentation for my thesis class, I was reflecting on how to define my aesthetic and themes. I was thinking about this quote from Tim Burton, \"Anyone who has artistic ambition is always trying to reconnect with the way they saw things as a child.\" This rings true for me - and there are two main elements feeding into the way I like to express things or build worlds. One is this sort of hyper-real, visceral textured style that I can see in avant-garde and couture fashion like MM6's haute couture SP24 show, or Rundholz ready to wear clothes, or Jan Svankmajer's films. There's something about that that recalls the way I felt as a child just taking everything in, feeling everything, noticing everything like it's new without judgement or value placement. Since I grew up in a town very close to a city and was not much of an outdoors person, most of these textures are food, building, and commercial product focused (toys, clothes, books, etc). The other half is the kind of learning or discovery weirdness that happens where adults are trying to create a framework for you to understand the world, and for me what I latched onto were these types of video games like Zoombinis or Busy Town, I was entranced by the movement of them and being able to be a part of worlds that I saw on TV or in books.",

I am thinking I might have to change the datapath to elsewhere on the player's computer, but then you run the risk of deleting the file. I suppose I could change it on quit to a file in the database. Another cool feature of this is the ability to save pngs with transparent background. This took a while to figure out and ended up being a combination of the texture2d type and how I created the bytes via code, which is available for reference on Github. I haven't been able to be as thorough with documentation this month because I have a truckload of work.",

It's tough and a bit stressful that it has taken so long to find my footing in this, but I have been working really hard at it and sometimes things, especially subjective and self-expression oriented projects, just take the time they're going to take.

          'This is my new outline for the structure of the game.  It\'s going to start in on a zoomed in collaged head that you use your hands in combination with some items that are orbiting the head to explore literally by such methods as pushing your hand into the eye socket or cutting off skin of the forehead. In this scene there is also another character, who verbally prompts you and is more or less ordering you around. It wants you to go in the head and bring it something back. You can either bring back food (your own flesh and blood) or a thought as in a drawing or a recitation, story type thing, or you can disobey and bring nothing.  These are the directions the story can go: You Lose: - If you disobey and bring nothing, you will be assaulted with increasing violence (first berated, then slapped, then stabbed, etc). This will also make you lose the game because you will be murdered. - If you continue to bring food, the face will become affected to move slower and seem as if it is slowly dying (you lose the game when it finally dies)  You get stuck in a loop: - If you continue to bring thoughts, you will lose more control of the game and what is happening, until you get stuck in the same loop over and over which will be something boring like a typing test.  You Win: - The only way to "win" the game is by tricking the other character into eating things that are inedible, or by lying about what you bring back (bad stories, false drawings)',

          "I wrote this song a while ago that I sent to Caleb who has been generous enough to help with music/sound on the project because I don’t have much experience in that area. The lyrics go like this:  You see me/I’m watching TV/I’m laughing, but I’m really laughing at you./I’m happy, so I’m laughing./But I’m really laughing at you./You really wanna kill me,/you keep on trying, but you’ll never catch me/that’s why when I’m laughing/I’m always laughing/at you!  It’s just me talking to the negative internalized voices in my head/my depression and other negative things that plague me.  It’s been helpful being able to collaborate with someone and getting some feedback and outside perspective on things I’ve been working on. Right now the \"other character\" I'm thinking of as the \"you\" in the laughing song, the personification of depression/self destructive side/robot person.  This song feels a bit vulnerable to share because I’m not used to making music and because of the subject matter, but I think because of that it feels more interesting to share and put out. I was trying to think of things that I feel more that way about. I did a lot of drawings when I was more depressed that were kind themed around a feeling of being in a mental prison and confusion around the desire to leave everything you know/yourself behind. I think I feel more that these drawings fit this category of 'even when they are externalized, they still feel like they are inside my head and if someone else looks at them, they are looking into my head in an uncomfortable wrong way because I don't believe they could see it the way I know I do'. Would be nice to think of a succinct way to say this.  I really like this game \"The Beginner's Guide\" which I would highly recommend playing but it's kind of a \"mockumentary\" video game, at least that's how I think about it. There's narration over sort of a tour/walkthrough of a friend of the narrator's game drafts, and there's this weird sort of relationship that you come to understand between the narrator and the creator of the games. It's about the same sort of idea I think, which I am having trouble putting into words. I guess it's about the push and pull that is the desire for intimacy and connection competing with the understanding that relationships are/communication is more about faith and some degree of randomness and the resulting range of emotions and outcomes that can be generated from that and you need to seek truth and satisfaction from your internal world. I don't really know how to narrow into that more, I'd have to think for a while.",

For example, I really like being able to customize my character in games so I built this drawing where you can change the colors of the character. It was a little tricky to figure out how to make this pervasive throughout scenes but I ended up using a list to apply a color to a group of sprites and saving the color with json. It's been a little finicky getting the colliders to sit in the right place so this works well. I thought using larger colliders would make it easier, but I've had more success with the precision of very small ones. I think I am also getting better at scripting in being able to use a similar, shorter script both for applying vs using the color on the brush based on a bool set in the inspector (paint vs. painted). I mimicked the inventory system for my windowsill items, so they will stay there if you return.",

I was able to modify my dialogue related scripts so that multiple different events can be triggered within a dialogue (before it only had the capability of one) via unity events I can assign in the inspector. That\'s been saving me a lot of time. That in tandem with using animation events in tandem with a simple unity events trigger script has been huge and widely used now for me.',

One thing I do regret is not having the player character fleshed out enough to where I could just make a prefab, I had to edit it in every scene and was afraid to go back on this in case it would break the scene for some strange thing I forgot I added to that particular instance of player. But, I don't think I would have been able to plan this out thoroughly so it's just a lesson learned for next time.",

          "This has been the deadline and the goal to have a project complete by May 7th. I am proud of what I did and accomplished what I set out to do. This week was a lot of QA; there was much more work to do than I anticipated, but luckily nothing that stumped me for too long. The thing that took the longest and most stubborn to figure out was fixing the UI for any resolution of screen. The UI/Canvas components are some of the weaker points of my knowledge with Unity. There are still a few glitches, and I intend to polish up everything before I release it more publicly. For now, I will keep an in progress version on this site.",
